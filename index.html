                <h3>HER ROYAL HOTNESS: Prince Harry secretly dating US TV star Meghan Markle</h3>
                <h5>PRINCE HARRY is secretly dating a stunning US actress, model and human rights
                    campaigner.</h5>

                <p>Friends say the red-haired royal Romeo, often dubbed the world’s most eligible bachelor,
                    has fallen for 35-year-old Meghan Markle.</p>

                <p>Insiders say Harry, 32, is “besotted” with the actress, best known for her role as
                    Rachel Zane in American TV legal drama Suits.</p>

                <p>In recent weeks royal watchers have noticed that Harry, fifth-in-line to the
                    throne, has had a notable spring in his step and can’t stop smiling.</p>

                <p>“He’s happier than he’s been for many years,” said a source close to the
                    Prince last night.</p>

                <p>“He’s in a very relaxed period of his life and Meghan has come along at the
                    right time. “They are taking each week as it comes and just enjoying each
                    other’s company but it’s fair to say that they love seeing each other and
                    there’s a definite chemistry between them.</p>

                <p>“Harry has been desperate to keep the relationship quiet because he doesn’t
                    want to scare Meghan off. He knows things will change when their romance
                    is public knowledge but he also knows he can’t keep it a secret for long.</p>

                <p>“It’s too early to say if the relationship will lead to anything long-term
                    but who knows? At the moment they are just taking it a step at a time
                    and seeing how things develop.”</p>

                <p>It is thought Harry met Meghan in May when he was in Toronto to promote the Invictus
                    Games
                    for disabled Servicemen. Meghan, who was born in Los Angeles, has lived in Toronto
                    for several years and made it her home because Suits is filmed there.</p>

                <p>She married her long-term boyfriend, film producer Trevor Engelson, in Jamaica in 2011,
                    but the couple split after just two years. Some claim they have divorced. Others say they
                    are still married but separated.</p>

                <p>Ironically Engelson, 40, bears a close physical similarity to Harry. Meghan’s most recent
                    boyfriend was a top Toronto chef, but at the moment she lives with just her two rescue
                    dogs
                    Bogart and Guy.</p>

                <p>She has made several visits to London and has been on discreet dinners with Harry and
                    out with
                    his friends.</p>

                <p>Friends say Harry has been treated to her “excellent cooking” and they both enjoy yoga.
                    She has stayed with him at Kensington Palace and met the Duke and Duchess of
                    Cambridge.</p>

                <p>“William and Kate really liked her and she fitted in straight away,” added the insider.</p>

                    strategy</h3>
                <h5>BUSINESS Secretary Greg Clark appears to have let slip Theresa May's Brexit
                    negotiating strategy
                    on the Andrew Marr show.</h5>

                <p>The Prime Minister has continually said she will not reveal her stance for Britain’s
                    exit from
                    the EU because it weakens Britain’s negotiating position.</p>

                <p>Parliament is demanding greater scrutiny amid concerns of a ‘hard’ Brexit
                    which will involve ending Britain’s membership of the European single market
                    in exchange for stricter controls of immigration.</p>

                <p>Despite repeatedly saying she will not provide a "running commentary" over negations,
                    the Business Secretary appeared to do just that.</p>

                <p>Discussing the government’s agreement with Nissan, Mr Clark told Marr:
                    "There is a lot of trade from the continent of Europe and vice-versa.</p>

                <p>"So one of the assurances I was able to give is that our intention,
                    our negotiating remit is to have a constructive and civilised dialogue to look
                    for the common interest here."</p>

                <img src="images/cold.jpg" alt="Cold">

                <p>Mild southerly breezes will be nudged away by bitter
                    northerly winds making things feel much more seasonal from Tuesday.</p>

                <p>It follows an unusually balmy start to autumn with thermometers expected
                    to touch the 18C (64F) mark tomorrow.</p>

                <p>Trick-or-treaters will enjoy a very mild Halloween with temperatures staying

                <h3>Hard Brexit 'may see Britain more than DOUBLE worth of failing EU agreements'
                    say experts</h3>
                <h5>A HARD Brexit could see Britain more than double the amount it currently earns
                    while part of the
                    failing Brussels bloc, experts claim.</h5>
                <address>By CHARLIE BAYLISS</address>
                <p>Change Britain found 14 countries – including China, Brazil, India and Australia
                    have publicly expressed a desire to strike a trade deal with Britain once Theresa
                    May finally triggers Article 50.</p>

                <p>The combined economic worth of the 14 nations who say they want trade deals with
                    Britain amounts to £17trillion – more than double the £7.2billion of the combined
                    GDP of nations who have deals with the EU.</p>

                <p>The group – established by Michael Gove and backed by Boris Johnson – warned that
                    Britain will
                    only be able to take advantage of that potential should the Prime Minister pull
                    us away from
                    the customs union.</p>

                <p>Secretary of State for International trade, Dr Liam Fox, is one of the key cabinet
                    members who
                    advocates leaving the customs union to give Britain more control of the trade deals
                    it strikes.</p>

                <p>Former CBI chief and trade minister to Gordon Brown, Lord Digby Jones, claimed such
                    a move would
                    open Britain up to “millions more customers”.</p>
