                <h3>HER ROYAL HOTNESS: Prince Harry secretly dating US TV star Meghan Markle</h3>
                <h5>PRINCE HARRY is secretly dating a stunning US actress, model and human rights
                    campaigner.</h5>

                <p>Friends say the red-haired royal Romeo, often dubbed the world’s most eligible bachelor,<br>
                    has fallen for 35-year-old Meghan Markle.<br>
                    Insiders say Harry, 32, is “besotted” with the actress, best known for her role as<br>
                    Rachel Zane in American TV legal drama Suits.<br>
                    <br>
                    In recent weeks royal watchers have noticed that Harry, fifth-in-line to the<br>
                    throne, has had a notable spring in his step and can’t stop smiling.<br>
                    <br>
                    “He’s happier than he’s been for many years,” said a source close to the<br>
                    Prince last night.<br>
                    <br>
                    “He’s in a very relaxed period of his life and Meghan has come along at the<br>
                    right time. “They are taking each week as it comes and just enjoying each<br>
                    other’s company but it’s fair to say that they love seeing each other and<br>
                    there’s a definite chemistry between them.<br>
                    <br>
                    “Harry has been desperate to keep the relationship quiet because he doesn’t<br>
                    want to scare Meghan off. He knows things will change when their romance<br>
                    is public knowledge but he also knows he can’t keep it a secret for long.<br>
                    <br>
                    “It’s too early to say if the relationship will lead to anything long-term<br>
                    but who knows? At the moment they are just taking it a step at a time<br>
                    and seeing how things develop.”<br>
                    <br>
                    It is thought Harry met Meghan in May when he was in Toronto to promote the Invictus<br>
                    Games<br>
                    for disabled Servicemen. Meghan, who was born in Los Angeles, has lived in Toronto<br>
                    for several years and made it her home because Suits is filmed there.<br>
                    <br>
                    She married her long-term boyfriend, film producer Trevor Engelson, in Jamaica in 2011,<br>
                    but the couple split after just two years. Some claim they have divorced. Others say they<br>
                    are still married but separated.<br>
                    <br>
                    Ironically Engelson, 40, bears a close physical similarity to Harry. Meghan’s most recent<br>
                    boyfriend was a top Toronto chef, but at the moment she lives with just her two rescue<br>
                    dogs Bogart and Guy.<br>
                    <br>
                    She has made several visits to London and has been on discreet dinners with Harry and<br>
                    out with his friends.<br>
                    <br>
                    Friends say Harry has been treated to her “excellent cooking” and they both enjoy yoga.<br>
                    She has stayed with him at Kensington Palace and met the Duke and Duchess of<br>
                    Cambridge.<br>
                    <br>
                    “William and Kate really liked her and she fitted in straight away,” added the insider.

                <h3>UK to STAY in single market? Business sec lets slip PM's Brexit negotiating
                    strategy</h3>
                <h5>BUSINESS Secretary Greg Clark appears to have let slip Theresa May's Brexit
                    negotiating strategy
                    on the Andrew Marr show.</h5>

                <p>The Prime Minister has continually said she will not reveal her stance for Britain’s<br>
                    exit from<br>
                    the EU because it weakens Britain’s negotiating position.<br>
                    <br>
                    Parliament is demanding greater scrutiny amid concerns of a ‘hard’ Brexit<br>
                    which will involve ending Britain’s membership of the European single market<br>
                    in exchange for stricter controls of immigration.<br>
                    <br>
                    Despite repeatedly saying she will not provide a &quot;running commentary&quot; over negations,<br>
                    the Business Secretary appeared to do just that.<br>
                    <br>
                    Discussing the government’s agreement with Nissan, Mr Clark told Marr:<br>
                    &quot;There is a lot of trade from the continent of Europe and vice-versa.<br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;So one of the assurances I was able to give is that our intention,<br>
                    our negotiating remit is to have a constructive and civilised dialogue to look<br>
                    for the common interest here.&quot;</p>

                <h3>Hard Brexit 'may see Britain more than DOUBLE worth of failing EU agreements'
                    say experts</h3>
                <h5>A HARD Brexit could see Britain more than double the amount it currently earns
                    while part of the
                    failing Brussels bloc, experts claim.</h5>
                <address>By CHARLIE BAYLISS</address>
                <p>Change Britain found 14 countries – including China, Brazil, India and Australia<br>
                    have publicly expressed a desire to strike a trade deal with Britain once Theresa<br>
                    May finally triggers Article 50.<br>
                    <br>
                    The combined economic worth of the 14 nations who say they want trade deals with<br>
                    Britain amounts to £17trillion – more than double the £7.2billion of the combined<br>
                    GDP of nations who have deals with the EU.<br>
                    <br>
                    The group – established by Michael Gove and backed by Boris Johnson – warned that<br>
                    Britain will<br>
                    only be able to take advantage of that potential should the Prime Minister pull<br>
                    us away from<br>
                    the customs union.<br>
                    <br>
                    Secretary of State for International trade, Dr Liam Fox, is one of the key cabinet<br>
                    members who<br>
                    advocates leaving the customs union to give Britain more control of the trade deals<br>
                    it strikes.<br>
                    <br>
                    Former CBI chief and trade minister to Gordon Brown, Lord Digby Jones, claimed such<br>
                    a move would<br>
                    open Britain up to “millions more customers”.</p>
